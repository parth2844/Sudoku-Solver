# Sudoku-Solver
• The project aims at development of a smart agent for solving the classic Sudoku board game using Artificial Intelligence techniques.
• Agent uses a backtracking approach along with heuristics for selecting the most optimal variable and value to generate solution.
• Boards of increasing complexities (sizes greater than 9x9) are also tested with this algorithm.
